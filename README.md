# MicroSim Demos
This repository provides a set of demos to showcase what MicroSim is capable of.
Mainly it highlights that within the same Hardware Developement Environment (HDE), one can design circuits ranging from simple gates to complex architectures.

## Interresting Demos
- 2 bit adder
- Darth Vador
- Counter
- Ben Eater's 8-bit computer

Note: if you have a `Gecko5Education` at your disposal, feel free to export your designs directly on the FPGA.
