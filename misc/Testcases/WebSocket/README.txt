This is a test to showcase the websocket communication. You will find the circuit that is intended to be simulated in the in the `WebSocket Demo.usim` and the equivalent commands in `Commands.txt`. To demo it, first launch the engine. Then go to the react_chat_ui/chat_ui and do `npm start` (might need to do `npm install` if it fails to launch). Then on the chat you can directly paste the commands one by oe to examine what is happening under the hood.
